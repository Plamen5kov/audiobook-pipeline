# Voice Cast Configuration
# Maps characters to TTS engines and voice profiles.
# Characters not listed here will use the "default" profile.
#
# Fields:
#   tts_service:    Docker service name — used as the "engine" value in /synthesize requests.
#                   Must match a key in tts-router's TTS_BACKENDS env var.
#                   Options: xtts-v2, qwen3-tts
#   tts_port:       Port the service listens on (used by tts-router's backend map).
#   reference_audio: Path to WAV reference clip (xtts-v2 only; ignored by other engines).
#   speed:          Playback speed hint (xtts-v2 only).
#   style_notes:    Human-readable notes (not consumed by any service).
#   qwen_speaker:   One of Qwen3-TTS's 9 predefined voices (qwen3-tts only).
#                   Options: Vivian, Serena, Uncle_Fu, Dylan, Eric, Ryan, Aiden, Ono_Anna, Sohee
#   qwen_instruct:  Baseline style instruction for Qwen (qwen3-tts only).
#                   The service appends an emotion phrase at synthesis time.
#
# To switch a character to a different engine, change tts_service (and tts_port).
# Example: tts_service: qwen3-tts / tts_port: 8007
