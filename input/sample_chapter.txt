Chapter 1: The Awakening

The old house stood at the edge of the village, its windows dark and its garden overgrown. No one had lived there for years, or so the villagers believed.

Elena pushed open the iron gate, wincing as it shrieked against the stone path. The sound echoed through the empty street behind her.

"Are you sure about this?" Marcus called from the sidewalk, his hands shoved deep into his coat pockets.

"When have I ever been sure about anything?" she replied without turning around. "That's never stopped me before."

Marcus sighed and followed her through the gate. The garden was worse up close. Thorny vines had claimed the walls, and the stone walkway had cracked and buckled under the pressure of roots pushing up from below.

"This place gives me the creeps," he muttered.

Elena reached the front door and tried the handle. It turned easily, which surprised her. She had expected locks, chains, maybe even boards nailed across the frame. Instead, the door swung open with barely a whisper.

Inside, the air was thick with dust and something else. Something sweet and faintly metallic. Elena wrinkled her nose.

"Hello?" she called into the darkness. Her voice bounced off unseen walls and faded into silence.

From somewhere deep within the house, a floorboard creaked.

Marcus grabbed her arm. "We should go," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Elena looked at him. In the faint light filtering through the doorway, she could see the fear in his eyes. She felt it too, a cold knot tightening in her chest. But she also felt something else. Curiosity. The same reckless curiosity that had gotten her into trouble a hundred times before.

"Five minutes," she said. "Just five minutes, and then we leave."

She stepped inside.
